# Netlife Research: Craft Starter

*Read through the readme*, and if you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask in either #frontend or #craft in Slack. If you have made some smart improvement to the tooling or setup of in your Craft procject, _please contribute to this starter by making a pull request_.

## Get started

1. Clone, or download this repository
2. Install global dependencies if not installed already (see bottom of file)
3. Install dependencies
4. Make a repository on GitHub
5. Set up a Heroku app for the first time or get up and running when somebody already set things up

## Changing the remote git repository

If you have cloned this project, the git remote `origin` is set to the craft-starter repository. Unless you're actually working on improving the craft-starter, you should set the remote `origin` to your project repository.

1. Remove the current `origin` with `git remote rm origin`
2. Add the new origin with `git remote add origin git@github.com:netliferesearch/repository-name`
3. Push to the new origin with `git push --set-upstream origin master`

## Dependencies

1. `composer install` (for all the PHP stuff)
2. `npm i` ([alternately `yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/)) (for all the JS and CSS stuff)

## Setting up the project on Heroku for the first time

Push this button (remember to set the correct region)

### Manually (like a pro)

Make sure you install global dependencies like Heroku toolbelt first.

1. `heroku create <name> --region eu`
2. `heroku buildpacks:add heroku/php`
2. `heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs`
3. `heroku addons:create jawsdb`
3. `heroku addons:create heroku-redis`
4. `heroku config -s | tr -d "'" > .env`
2. `heroku config:add NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`
5. Update `general.php` with the heroku app {{name}}

## Up and running when somebody already set things up
1. `heroku git:remote <name>`
2. `heroku config -s | tr -d "'" > .env`
3. Get your local database up and running or connect to the remote database


## Heroku local configuration

`<name>` is the name of your app. E.g `https://<name>.herokuapp.com/`

1. Make sure that you've logged in, and have access to the project on Heroku: `heroku login`
2. Make sure that this folder has the correct Heroku app as an git remote `heroku git:remote <name>`
3. Run `heroku config --app <name> -s | tr -d "'" > .env` in terminal

`heroku config` lists out the configuration (a.k.a. environment variables) in your heroku app in the :cloud:. To save them locally in a file, we will first need the ouput in a shell format, thus we put the `-s` flag in. Heroku spits out database urls with `''`, which tend to create some trouble. Therefore we _pipe_ the output from `heroku config` by using this [`|`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) and a [`tr -d "'"`](http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=tr+-d+%22%27%22) that deletes these. With this output we can _write_ it to a `.env` file with `>`.

If you e.g. have installed a new add-on and just want to _append_ this to the .env-configuration file, you can do so with this command

`heroku config:get REDIS_URL -s |tr -d "'" >> .env` (`>>` appends the output to a new line in the file, while a single `>` would overwrite the whole file).

## Developing on a local database

_You should probably use Docker_.

This project is set up to use the JAWSDB as the mysql addon on Heroku. Provided that it is used, you can run this command in bash from your project folder to download a dump of the database:

```bash
heroku config:get JAWSDB_URL|sed -E 's%mysql:\/\/(.+):(.+)@(.+)(:3306| )\/(.+)(\?reconnect=true)%mysqldump --host=\3 --user=\1 --password=\2 \5 > dump.sql%'|sh
```

This command first gets the mysql-url for JAWSDB in the Heroku config. Then it pipes it to `sed`, which [parses it through regex](https://regex101.com/r/EeO9HR/1) and outputs the `mysqldump` command with proper credentials. This text string is piped into `sh` which runs it. With `> dump.sql` we make sure that the output (which is a bunch of sql insert commands) is saved to a file with the name dump.sql.

This file can then be imported into any mysql database, including your local.

1. If typing `mysql` in the terminal does nothing, install it with `brew install mysql`
2. Make sure it runs by typing `mysql.server start`
3. Set `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@127.0.0.1/databasename` in your .env-file. The username is usually `root`. If your database has no password, just omit colon and password-string (`user@127…`)
4. Run this command from the folder with the dump.sql file to import the database dump, assuming that both username and password is `root`:

```bash
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --user=root --password=root databasename < dump.sql
```

Done!

## Install craft
Go to [http://localhost:5000/admin](http://localhost:5000/admin) and follow the wizard to install craft.

If you want to change this URL, you'll have to change it in `start.sh`. If you want to use browser-sync, you'll have to change it in `webpack.config.js` (line 58) as well.

## Start working

`npm run dev` starts the web server + webpack. Webpack processes Sass + JS. This craft-starter comes ready with [Browser-Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/) – that means that you don't *need* CodeKit.

Edit Sass and JavaScript in the `/resources/`-folder. Webpack will compile, transpile, minify it into the `public` folder, ready for production. If you put files in the assets-folder, Webpack will handle those too. The `style.scss` is built into `public/style.css` and it injects vendor prefixes and inlines smaller static resources (icon fonts for example). The file `resources/js/app.js` is built into `public/js/min/app.min.js`, and it uses Browserify + Babel, allowing you to both write ES6 as well as using a Node.js style if you prefer.

Both files are properly included in `craft/templates/_layout.twig`

## Global dependencies for the starter-pack

Perform the following steps in a terminal:
You only need to do this once per system.

### PHP
* Install homebrew: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
* `brew tap homebrew/dupes`
* `brew tap homebrew/versions`
* `brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php`
* `brew install php70 php70-mcrypt php70-imagick php70-redis composer`
* `brew link php70`

If you have problems with php70-magick, you can fix it with this command:

```bash
brew uninstall imagemagick && brew install imagemagick@6 && brew link imagemagick@6 --force
```

### Node Version Manager + tools

* Install Heroku toolbelt <https://toolbelt.heroku.com/>
  * `brew install heroku`
* `brew install nvm`

### Troubleshooting

>Peow peow!

- Amazon S3: Craft CMS 2.x doesn't support bucket location Frankfurt because it uses a newer authentication method.
